Using two-tailed t-tests with an alpha level of 0.01, there was a significant difference before and after Fairy Type's inclusion in both Dragon Type usage and Super Effective move usage. "

    "Pokémon Showdown is a Pokémon battle simulator that allows players to build teams of Pokémon and battle each other online in various battle formats. In a Pokémon battle, each player has a team of 6 Pokémon, and each Pokémon has 4 different moves that can be used in battles. Every Pokémon has 1 or 2 types, which determines their strengths and weaknesses against other Pokémon types, and each move also has 1 type. Each Pokémon is assigned a limited pool of usable moves that can include other types besides its own. \n",
    "Prior to the 6th generation of Pokémon, there were 17 Pokémon types. However, Gen VI saw the introduction of the Fairy type, which created a major shift in type dynamics. Fairy types are weak to Poison and Steel and super effective against Dark, Fighting, and, most notably, Dragon. Fairy is the only type that is both super effective against and completely immune to Dragon types, a type which has historically been popular in competitive Pokémon battles because of their high stats (the highest average stat total of all types, according to Bulbapedia) and few type weaknesses. Nicholas Vadivelu’s analysis on competitive Pokémon found that Fairy type Pokemon have become quite prominent in upper competitive tiers, which effectively puts them in direct competition with Dragon types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokemon Showdown has two major formats: Ubers and OU. Each format has different restrictions on what Pokemon are allowed based on how dominating a Pokemon is. OU has more restrictions on Pokemon than Ubers, banning Pokemon that are too powerful to allow Pokemon that are less used to be more effective. Ubers has the least restrictions and allows players to use the Pokemon that they would like with a few minor exceptions. The introduction of Fairy types in generation 6 affect the use of Dragon types differently in each format as different Fairy types are allowed in each tier. \n",

    "With the addition of the new Fairy type in Generation 6, we predicted that types effective against Fairy type (Poison, Steel) would increase in usage, while the Dragon type, which is weak to Fairy type, would decrease in usage. We would also expect Ice types, another counter to Dragon types, to decrease in usage. We predicted that the trend would remain consistent as more Fairy type Pokemon are added to the game with each generation."

These bans are put into place if the Smogon/Pokemon Showdown community deems a specific Pokemon to be too dominating in the metagame. The changes caused by bans can be mitigated if we analyze the datasets towards the beginning of a generation, where no bans are implemented due to the lack of data at the beginning of a generation to vote on a ban.\n",

    "Throughout our data analysis project, our group sought to better understand how the inclusion of the Fairy Type Pokemon in Generation VI changed competitive battling dynamics and stats within Pokemon Showdown - especially in relation to the previously dominant Dragon Type Pokemon. We began our observations by collecting data from the website ‘Smogon,’ which serves as a comprehensive online resource for competitive Pokemon statistics and battling tactics. We looked at Pokemon battling rating, usage and move percentages across five generations (Generations 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) as well as individual Pokemon features and characteristics. For analysis, we joined this data together to specifically observe moveset usage, pokemon usage, and effectiveness against either Dragon or Fairy types. \n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting our analysis, we concluded that the addition of Fairy type Pokemon did in fact have a significant effect on overall Dragon type usage within Pokemon Showdown Ubers and OU formats. Our data visualizations depict a relatively consistent increase of Fairy type usage, as well as an increase in effective movesets against Fairy type which flipped the dominating type in the generations/years following their inclusion in the game - just as we hypothesized. Our charts also revealed that To solidify our conclusion, we utilized inferential statistics for our Dragin usage and effective moveset data. The result showcased that Dragon type usage after Generation 6 dramatically decreased due to the inclusion of a new viable counter type Pokemon, and the effective move usage against the Dragon and Fairy types had decreased and increased respectively. It can be safely deduced from our data analysis that the domination of the Dragon type over Pokemon competitive battling required a worthy counter in order to level its playing usage in battle formats online, and the introduction of Fairy type allowed players to select a team with more diverse type range and movesets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible limitations of our analysis\n",
    "*Possible limitations + future expansion of project*\n",
    "- limitation: data begins at 2014 rather than 2013, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- potential idea: look into dark and steel type, as they were added in generation 2 and the metagame for those is essentially done, meaning more data\n",
    "- con: showdown doesn't necessarily have data for the complete metagame, as it obviously didn't exist when gens 1, 2, 3 were a thing "
